# Startup and Initialization Protocols

This protocol is designed for developers and AI agents (Agents) to follow at the start of every new session to ensure full alignment with the project's structure and rules.

## 📋 Direct Commands (Copy and Paste)

> **"Execute the Full Startup Protocol:**
> 1. Read the `frist.txt` file and treat it as the strict 'Code Constitution' (var rules, documentation, language).
> 2. Read and analyze all files in the `maintenance/` directory to build a current mental model.
> 3. Do not start any programming work until you confirm your understanding with the phrase: 'Thank you for explaining the project structure.'**

## 🛠 What Happens During This Protocol?

1. **Logic Alignment**: The agent remembers specific project constraints (e.g., prohibition of `let/const` in global scope, no gradients, no hover).
2. **Data Refresh**: The internal model is updated with API details, Stepper workflows, and order logic to prevent conflicts.
3. **Technical Handshake**: The process ends with a confirmation message, signifying the agent is 100% safe to receive complex tasks.

## ⚠️ Important Warnings
- **No Shortcuts**: Do not allow the AI agent to skip this step in new conversations.
- **Mental Model Integrity**: If the agent suggests a change that contradicts the maintenance documentation, re-run the protocol immediately.
