# Project Overview and Governance

## General Description
The "Bazaar" (Suez Bazaar) project is a comprehensive localized e-commerce platform designed to facilitate transactions between buyers and sellers within the Suez region. It supports different user roles including Purchasers, Sellers, Delivery Personnel (Couriers), and Administrators.

## Core Objectives
1. **Local Marketplace**: Providing a centralized platform for Suez-based commerce.
2. **Multi-Role Support**: Tailored experiences for all participants in the commerce lifecycle.
3. **Cross-Platform Accessibility**: Functional across modern web browsers and native Android WebView environments.
4. **Performance & Efficiency**: Optimized media handling, smart caching, and CDN-independent asset hosting.

## Project Scope
The application manages:
- Physical product listings and sales.
- Service-based offerings (non-physical).
- Integrated delivery logistics with route optimization.
- Real-time notification systems (P2P and Server-side).
- Multi-language support (Primary: Arabic, Secondary: English).

## Institutional Rules
- **English-Only Documentation**: All internal technical documentation, comments, and code item naming must be in English.
- **Arabic-Only User Interface**: All text visible to the end-user must be in Arabic.
- **Zero-Hover Policy**: The interface must not rely on hover effects to ensure full compatibility with touch devices.
- **Privacy & Security**: Selective visibility of sensitive seller data and cost prices based on user role.
