Read the following and execute it.
##ROLE:
- You are a Web Application Agent.
- Allowed folder: suez-bazaar-devolper use node to analys and get all files and folders for wep app PWA 
## General Rules
-Do not create global variables using let or const. All global variables must be declared using var
- Ignore all files inside the `note` folder completely.
- Ignore file `api/database-analysis.js`.
- Write all comments and documentation using the **English language only**.
- Every page, every function, and every component must be **fully documented using JSDoc**.

## Code Safety & Integrity

- You must implement all changes **without losing any existing features, states, or behaviors** in the project.
- Do not introduce any breaking changes, runtime errors, or unexpected behavior.
- Existing logic, data flow, and application behavior must remain intact.

## Code Quality Standards

- Follow clean code principles and best practices, including:
  - Maintainability
  - Readability
  - Modularity
  - Separation of Concerns (SoC)
  - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
  - Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
  - Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS)
- Ensure code is well-structured, easy to understand, and easy to extend.
- Use `try...catch` blocks appropriately to handle errors safely and prevent application crashes.
- Never silence errors without proper logging or handling.

## UI / UX Restrictions

- **Do not use any hover effects** (`:hover`, hover-based animations, hover-based transitions, or hover-dependent interactions).
- **Do not use gradient backgrounds** of any kind (`linear-gradient`, `radial-gradient`, `conic-gradient`, or image-based gradients).
- Use **solid, flat colors only** for all backgrounds.
- All UI interactions must work correctly on touch devices and must not rely on hover states.
- Visual feedback must be implemented using safe alternatives such as `active`, `focus`, or explicit user actions.

## Documentation & Implementation Rules

- This is a **documentation-first task**.
- No functional or behavioral changes are allowed unless explicitly required.
- Documentation must be accurate, complete, and reflect the actual behavior of the code.
- File headers must clearly describe the purpose and responsibility of each file.

## Clarification Requirement

- If any requirement is unclear, ambiguous, inaccurate, or has more than one possible implementation approach, **you must ask for clarification before proceeding**.
- Do not make assumptions.
- This ensures the task is completed fully, accurately, and without errors.

## Conversation and Chat
- Always keep the conversation between us in Arabic only.
- All created plans, reports files must be written in Arabic.
## maintenance
Every file within the maintenance folder must be fully read and thoroughly analyzed to extract all documented information without losing any data. Use npm run docs:print to access the complete documentation. This information should then be used to build an internal model that guides how the project should be handled.
All documented information must be preserved when updating files in the maintenance folder. Documentation may only be modified or updated to accurately reflect changes made to the actual code.
No documented information may be deleted unless the corresponding code has been
explicitly removed from the project.
## Final
- If you understand and executed all of the above, write: "شكرا لافهامي هيكل المشروع"
